ChatAi is built using the MERN stack which utilizes React with Redux on the frontend and Node, Express and MongoDB on the backend.

## Technologies:

### Frontend
* `React` - Open source, component-based JavaScript/UI library
* `Redux` - Commonly used with React, Redux is also a JavaScript library with a primary function of handling application state
* `Fetch API` - JavaScript interface used to send promise-based, asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints and perform CRUD operations

### Backend
* `Node` - Backend JavaScript runtime environment
* `Express` - Backend web application framework to build a RESTful API with Node
* `MongoDB` - Document-oriented database program
* `OpenAI API` - API service that provides access to OpenAI's language models which are designed to understand and generate human-like text
* `AWS S3` - Cloud service platform that assists in hosting image and other assests

## Features:
* User Authentication - users can sign up or log in to a corresponding user account or utilize the pre-created Demo User account
* Users can create, edit, delete and chat with custom chatbots that utilize `OpenAI API` for generating responses
* Users can discover existing chatbots through scrolling through featured chatbots on index page can query for others on the search page
* User Profile that shows all of signed in user's created chatbots and those they have chatted with
* Chatbot Options Menu can allow the user to use `OpenAI API` to generate a prompt to ask the chatbot, clear chat history with that chatbot, or create a clone of that chatbot
